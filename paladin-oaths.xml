            <p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Beauty hold themselves to a lofty standard of excellence. They strive to appear as beautiful gleaming beacons of elegance. Some use the power of their graceful visage to inspire and give hope to the downtrodden. Others turn inwards and become obsessed with their appearance and standing in society, using the power of their Oath to seduce, deceive, and intimidate those beneath them.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF BEAUTY</h5>
            <p>Those who swear this Oath do so for both altruistic and selfish purposes, but they share they all share these tenets.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Elegance.</em></strong> You must hold yourself to the highest societal standards, expectations, and customs. Reputation can open many doors that remain closed to those of ill repute.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Grace.</em></strong> You are a cut above the poor and working class, and you must exemplify that dignity in your combat techniques, leisurely pursuits, and all your public actions.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Perfection.</em></strong> Those who swear this Oath should strive always to improve themselves in not only their skill in combat, but their personal appearance and reputation.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bravery.</em></strong> To be a coward is worse then death. Those who don't defend themselves deserve whatever comes. Live in such a way that all will sing of your deeds for years to come.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Freedom.</em></strong> Mortal creatures are meant to be free. Like the fish of the sea, no one should be forced to follow rules that they did not personally agree to or have a voice in creating.</p>
